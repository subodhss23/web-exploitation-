- Same origin policy
- Relaxation of the same-origin policy

==========================================================
- Vulnerabilities arising from CORS configuration issue
==========================================================

1. Server-generated ACAO header from client-specified origin header
- CORS vulnerabilitiy with basic origin reflection

2. Error parsing origin header

3. Whitelisted null origin value
- CORS vulnerability with trusted null origin

4. Exploiting XSS via CORS trust relationships

5. Breaking TLS with poorly configured CORS
- CORS vulnerability with trusted insecure protocols.

6. Intranets and CORS without  credentials
- CORS vulnerability with internal network pivot attack.

============================================================
How to prevent CORS-based attack
============================================================

1. Proper configuration of cross-domain requests

2. Only allow trusted sites

3. Avoid whitelisting null

4. Avoid wildcards in internal networks
