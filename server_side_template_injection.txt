- constructing a server-side template injection attack

    - detect -> identify -> exploit -> read -> explore -> attack


1. Detect

    - plaintext context
    - code context
    

2. Identify

3. Exploit

    - learn the basic template syntax
    - read about the security implications
    - look for known exploits

4. Explore

    - Developer-supplied objects

5. Create a custom attack

    - constructing a custom exploit using an object chain
    - constructing a custom exploit using developer-supplied objects.

How to prevent server-side template injection vulnerabilities

===========================================================================

- not allow any users to modify or submit new templates. ( however, this is 
    sometimes unavoidable due to business requirements.)

- separationg the logic from presentation.

- execure users' code in a sandbox environment.

- deploying your template environment in a locked-down docker container.
