- How do HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities arise?
============================================================================

    - Content-Length
    - Transfer-Encoding: chunked

    - The chunked encoding can be used in HTTP requests, for two reasons:-
        - burp suite automatically unpacks chunked encoding to make messages easier to view and edit.
        - browsers do not normally use chunked encoding in requests, and it is normally seen only in server responses.
